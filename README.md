# Mined Minds Kata
The Mined Minds Kata is a variation of the famous fizzbuzz interview question. When run in the terminal it will print the numbers from 1 through 100 replacing multiples of 3 with mined, multiples of 5 with minds, and multiples of 3 and 5 with minedminds.

The files in this repository contain different variations of the Kata that I used to help myself learn the Kata and to help other students in the class work through it as well.
